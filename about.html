                <h2>Dora Yi-Chen Weng</h2>
                <p>I am currently a first-year Master's student in the School of Information at the University of Michigan, focusing on human-computer interaction, social computing, and UX design. </p>
                <p>Prior to studying at UM, I was a UX consultant at SAP, which launched my wonderful UX journey. I am passionate about understanding people's workflows on a variety of contexts and streamlining the flows and interactions with simplified designs and visualized data. <strong>I believe a crafted rendering with user-centered designs can help people make better decisions.</strong></p>
                <p>With a Master's degree in Materials Engineering, I had been a semiconductor engineer for 3 years. I switched my career because I aspire to have a direct impact on people's thoughts and needs. </p>
                <p>Coming from a diverse background, I am always open-minded and embrace any possibility!  </p>
